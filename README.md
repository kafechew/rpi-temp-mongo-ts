## Project description

### Project idea

Manual labor and monitoring on water quality affected the mortality of the fishes.

Fixed location sensors are installed to multiple fish ponds for water quality monitoring and optimal predictive maintenance scheduling.

### The potential outcomes

Build a smart fish pond monitoring system to produce good quality fish and aquatic plants.

### Technical details

Our PoC was built purely based on temperature sensor only (later we can add more sensors, like electrical conductivity (EC), dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, salinity, carbon dioxide, ammonia, nitrite, hardness, turbidity and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of water). 

Temperature is an important water quality parameter. It can affect fish and shrimp metabolism, feeding rates and the degree of ammonia toxicity. Temperature also has a direct impact on biota respiration (O2 consumption) rates and influences the solubility of O2 (warmer water holds less O2 than cooler water).
